# Metrics
* X-axis: each separated runtime step (phases)
* Y-axis: execution time (secs)

# TODO
* Force odd numbers to appear in X-axis
* Remove the "colors"/rectangules from the legend.
* Fix legend: how is it possible to exist a "create_histogram" if the experiment used summary? Rename it to "create_summary"
